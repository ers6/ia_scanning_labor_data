access-ia-metadata-records: contains the scripts and procedures for actually accessing the metadata records from the IA api as well as joining the disparate tables together into the full texts dataset. 
geocodes_text_dataset.py : geocodes the texts dataset
calculate_stats.ipynb : uses the geocodes texts dataset to create the csv files in the csv_file directory (should rename that to something clearer)

to do: rename the csv directory because it's confusing 
create a separate directory (probably the renamed csv one) to put scripts about analyzing the scans in.
